					<div class='subsubsection'>

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='subsubsection'>
						<h3>Digital Archive</h3>
						<p>
							The digital archive is accessible via the search of a specific object like <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/H_1921-1101-75" target="blank">this</a>. The straight link to it is not so clear.

							<ul>
								<li><span class='li_higlight'>Object Type</span></li>
								<li>Museum number</li>
								<li>Description</li>
								<li><span class='li_higlight'>Cultures/periods</span></li>

					<div class='subsubsection'>
						<h3>Online Collection</h3>
						<p>
							The British Museum offers a wide variety of online material, such as 3D renderings, virtual tours and a blog. This choice allows this institution to interact with virtual users and by consequence to enlarge it's newtwork of visitors. An online museum is not only a place to visit in a school trip or in a vacancy but also a source of knowledge that is always available and in continuous transformation.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class='subsubsection'>
						<h3>Blog</h3>
						<p>
							Since the Museum offers a lot of different experiences that change during time, a blog is a useful instrument to collect some articles relative to the temporary exibitions ad events and to organize an editorial. This allows to keep tidy and restrained the content of the website and at the same time to be a dynamic institution.

					<h2>Technologies</h2>
					<div class='subsubsection'>
						<h3>Virtual tour</h3>
						<p>
							The archive has a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/streetview/british-museum/AwEp68JO4NECkQ?sv_lng=-0.1266024509257022&sv_lat=51.51905368906714&sv_h=306&sv_p=0&sv_pid=JeKwUFYAMWXNWPh3IOg3jw&sv_z=1" target="blank">page</a> in Google Arts & Culture project where is possible to navigate the gallleries in a street-view-like mode. The exploration is facilitated by the use of linked images in the bottom of the page that guide the user among the most relevant artifacts.
						</p>
					</div>
					
				
					<div class='subsubsection'>
						<h3>3D models</h3>
						<p>
							A set of 3D renderings of the artworks is available in <a href="https://sketchfab.com/britishmuseum" target="blank">Sketchfab</a>. Some of them have an integrated audio-guide. 
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class='subsection'>
					<h2>Conditions of possibility</h2>
					<p>
						It's intuitable that a so huge collection of information and materials of different typology has to be managed by a wide team. The quality of the photographies and of the copywrite indicates that professional figures have been involved in the construction of the archive.
						It's possible however that the stable team is quite reducted and only manages the editorial content, while many professionals were involved to create the archive's database system and all the digital material, such as the photographs and the 3D models.
